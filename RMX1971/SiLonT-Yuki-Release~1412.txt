SilonT - Kernel

- Release 6 - Yuki

- Kernel version : 4.9.257

- Compiler : SilonT Clang (Clang 13) with LTO

-- Notes --

- Initial Android 11 based kernel, yay

Kernel is rebased to msm89xx Android 11 tag with SDM710 tag merged in, 
we also switched to efficient CPU freqs, thanks to kdrag0n and kras!

Both stock ROM (Realme UI), ports (Oxygen OS, MIUI) and custom ROMs are supported,
Although, off-screen gesture on stock and Oxygen OS does not work cause of a different node. Ill need some more time to fix it so please bear with it :)
